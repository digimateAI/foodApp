1. User experience and clarity
How will first-time users understand the value of taking pictures of food compared to manually entering it? Will there be a short guided demo or tooltip overlay?
A short demo video will be recorded when the app goes live

Will you allow partial photo recognition (e.g. “half eaten meals”)? How do you plan to handle portion estimation visually?
Parked for future enhancement

How do you ensure frictionless correction when the AI misrecognizes food — can users “teach” the model over time?
All the data will be stored in a backend db for future RLHF development

Have you considered gamification (badges, streaks, or progress achievements) to enhance user retention beyond 4–6 weeks?
Parked for future enhancement


2. Data and personalization
Will calorie and macro recommendations adjust dynamically based on user logging behavior (adaptive TDEE)?
Don't know how to do that.

Are you tracking adherence accurately (e.g., % of logged days) for feedback loops and goal recalibration?
Yes should do that

How do you intend to handle local food variation in recognition (esp. Indian dishes that are mixed/multi-component)?
We will use LLM model for food calorie tracking for this

Will you maintain a “local food dictionary” trained via community corrections?
Yes


3. AI and backend logic
Are you planning to build or integrate a food image recognition API (e.g., custom fine-tuned model vs. third-party like CalorieMama/FoodAI)?
yes
How will your backend aggregate image + text corrections to continuously refine the recognition model (active learning pipeline)?
you may propose, how should I do it.
Will macro estimation be unified across sources (photo recognition vs. manual database) to prevent inconsistency?
you may propose, how should I do it.
Have you defined an error confidence threshold for the model—e.g., below 70% confidence → ask user confirmation?
Any user any way

4. Health accuracy and trust
How will you communicate uncertainty in calorie predictions to avoid overpromising precision (e.g., “±10% estimated”)?
Yes
Will there be disclaimers or an educational layer (as present in your Calorie Calculation README) integrated contextually during setup?
No need
Have you considered optional verification via wearables (e.g., automatic calorie balance check from TDEE vs. logged meals)?
No

5. Business & differentiation
What is your unique moat vs. other calorie tracking apps like MyFitnessPal or Yazio? Is the core differentiator photo recognition quality, regional food accuracy, or adaptive metabolic insights?
photo recognition quality, regional food accuracy, & adaptive metabolic insights are my 

Will the app eventually offer AI-driven nutrition guidance (“your protein intake is trending low — try higher-protein breakfasts”)?
Yes, thats the ultimate goal

Are you positioning it as a consumer wellness app or considering insurance / employer wellness tie-ins later?
consumer wellness app

6. Scalability and compliance
How are you planning to store and anonymize meal photos (GDPR/India DPDP compliance)?
you may propose, how should I do it.

Will users have an option to delete image data or keep it for AI personalization purposes?
No
If wearables are connected, how will you handle third-party API rate limits and version mismatches (Apple/Google Health updates)?
Yes
